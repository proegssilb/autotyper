autotyper
=========

Small snippet of JS to automatically type lines from a file.

Currently, the file is hard-coded. Since I only need this project
in a prototype state, I have no plans to change that. Feel free to fork
if you need better.

For quick prototyping, based on HackerTyper, by Simone Masiero.
